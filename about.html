    <p><strong> OJUADE HAMMED BOLUWATIFE</p>
    <p>My name is Hammed, but my close friends call me Lexyham (or just Lexy). I’m a student at Ekiti State University (EKSU), studying Applied Geophysics in the Geology Department—one of the most fascinating fields in the world!, I hail from Ile-Ife, Osun State, a place rich in history, mystery, and captivating stories. It’s truly one of Nigeria’s most beautiful and culturally significant cities. Personality-wise, I’m a gentle, easygoing guy with a clear mind—though I can be a little troublesome sometimes (but that’s just part of my charm!). Physically, I’m tall with a light complexion. There’s more to me, of course, but you’ll discover that with time. Stick around!
